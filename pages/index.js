        Even though I started my career as a full stack developer, over the years I gradually moved to a full time
        frontend development role. The combination of design, interactivity, and raw user feedback are aspects of the
        job that always fascinated me. My plan for the future is to continuously expand my knowledge in this part of
        the development spectrum, and to become an active open source contributor.

        After static HTML and CSS templates, custom WordPress plugins and themes, REST APIs written on top of Laravel
        (PHP) and Express (Node.js), in the last two years I moved my focus solely on SPA (single page application)
        frontend development. Below is a list of technologies which I used in production projects in the recent past.

            With over two years of continuos development experience, from small promotional websites to big dashboards
            with hundreds of different components, React is my technology of choice for almost any kind of frontend
            development project.

            As my go-to solution for server-side rendered React application, I successfully used Next.js in several
            production projects. Fast, light, and easy to use, it helped me achieve a drastic increase in loading
            times, while keeping a clean and modular React codebase, with the advantages of a server rendered one.

            Even though it`s a recent addition to my toolset, I`m already seeing the benefits of adopting TypeScript in
            my workflow. Keeping sanity and consistency in a big codebase or team is always a big challenge, and with
            TypeScript it has become much easier.
